## Description
This tool allows for the visualization of raw binary data in a way that uses the patterns inherent within structured data to identify the information it contains. This tool does not use headers or file extensions.

Our goal initially will be to create a working prototype in C++ using OpenGL. Then, depending on how much time we have left, we will explore creating an desktop application (on some or all of the major platforms) or a web app.

## Vision Statement
Ever wanted to look like a hacker, but sadly the movies always look cooler than what you actually do? This tool is both useful for looking at data and super sweet.

## Motivation
We've seen examples in papers and a TED Talk, but have not been able to find a place where this software is available, and we would like to make it so.

## Risks
### Testing
* Lack of reliable testing data
  * Solution: Create our own
* Possibility that the results are not as clear as others have claimed
  * Solution: Live with it

### OpenGL
* Only one of our team knows OpenGL, so we need to make sure that we can learn that library
  * Solution: That member of the team can do all the work

### Scope
* Underestimating the scope of the project may end with us aiming too high
  * Solution: Take this into account when setting deadlines
* We may run into issues if we want to make this app work on all platforms
  * Solution: Make a webapp if it's too hard

### Team Work
* Josh is a loose cannon, dammit, but he's the best we've got
* Izaak is known to have ties with the Communist Party

### Other
* The government may notice our work and flag it as hacking related
  * Solution: Pray

## Requirements

### User Requirements
* 1. As a user I would like a graphical interface to easily manipulate the program with
  * 8 hours
* 2. As a user, I would like to have a file uploading feature so I can run the program on arbitrary binaries
  * 1 hour
* 3. As a user, I would like the product to generate a visual representation of a binary file to anaylze 
  * 8 hours
* 4. As a user, I want saving capabilities to store my requirements
  * 1 hour

### Functional Requirements
* 5. As a programmer, I'd like the program to be able to load binary data so that it could be visually encoded
  * 3 hours
* 6. As a programmer, I'd like to render the image in OpenGL to allow for fast rendering
  * 8 hours
* 7. Formal Data with C++

### Non-Functional Requirements
* 8. As a user I'd like a compact UI to make it easier to interact with the program
  * 4 hours
* 9. As a l33t h4x0r I'd like it to look sweet, like movie hacking, so I can look aw3s0m3!
  * 3 hours
