## Description
This tool allows for the visualization of raw binary data in a way that uses the patterns inherent within structured data to identify the information it contains. Here is the ted talk which introduced the idea to us https://youtu.be/cWpRxyqDgpM?t=451. This tool does not use headers or file extensions.

Our goal initially will be to create a working prototype in C++ using OpenGL. Then, depending on how much time we have left, we will explore creating an desktop application (on some or all of the major platforms) or a web app.

This tool could be used for applications such as data mining, 

## Vision Statement
Ever wanted to look like a hacker, but sadly the movies always look cooler than what you actually do? This tool is both useful for looking at data and super sweet.

## Motivation
We've seen examples in papers and a TED Talk, but have not been able to find a place where this software is available, and we would like to make it so.

## Risks
### Testing
* Lack of reliable testing data
  * Solution: Create our own
* Possibility that the results are not as clear as others have claimed
  * Solution: Live with it

### OpenGL
* Only one of our team knows OpenGL, so we need to make sure that we can learn that library
  * Solution: That member of the team can do all the work

### Scope
* Underestimating the scope of the project may end with us aiming too high
  * Solution: Assume everything will take 3 times as long
* We may run into issues if we want to make this app work on all platforms
  * Solution: Make a webapp if it's too hard

### Team Work
* Josh is a loose cannon, dammit, but he's the best we've got
* Izaak is known to have ties with the Communist Party

### Other
* The government may notice our work and flag it as hacking related
  * Solution: Pray

## Requirements

### User Requirements
* Graphical Interface
* File Input
* Visualization Generation
* Saving Capabilities

### Functional Requirements
* Load Binary Data
* Render Image in OpenGL
* Formal Data with C++

### Non-Functional Requirements
* Compact UI
* Looks Sweet, like Movie Hacking
