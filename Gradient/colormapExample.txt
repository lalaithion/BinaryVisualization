//This is an example Colormap file
//Colormap files have a very precise syntax
//Any line beginning with two backslashes is a comment
//All whitespace (except newlines) is ignored

//The first line in a Colormap file should be text within quotes.
//The name between these quotes is the name of the colormap.
//Every Colormap file should have this line
"Colormap Name"

//After the name comes the gradient.
//Each section of the gradient contains two numbers
//One is a floating point value between 0 and 1, inclusive.
//The other is a RGB color value in hexadecimal.
//These two numbers are separated by a >
//Each section is then separated by a semicolon.
//The following colormap is a simple greyscale

0 > #000000
1 > FFFFFF

//The # is optional.
//other example colormaps are as follows, but commented out.

//"Green"
//0 > #000000
//1 > #00AA00

//"Blue to Cyan"
//0 > #000000
//0.333 > #0000FF
//0.667 > #00FFFF
//1 > #FFFFFF

//"Heatmap"
//0 > #000000
//0.25 > #0000FF
//0.5 > #00FF00
//0.75 > #FF0000
//1 > #FFFFFF

//"Purple and Orange"
//0 > #000000
//.333 > #330066
//1 > #FF6600

//One last very important thing; due to a bug I have yet to fix, the last line of a colormap file must be an empty newline, or a comment. Otherwise the parsing will not work.
