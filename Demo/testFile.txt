This file is a test. It's characters are graphed by the texture_test.c program. I guess it's Copyright because I did write it, but I don't really mind if you steal it. Everything else you shouldn't steal, though. Or at least credit us if you do. Or whatever. It's your life, I'm not your boss.

...yet.

Hahaha! It's me, a pirate from the seven seas, here to steal your copyright! I will wreak havoc on this text file, and write enough extra text so that it is called transformative! Then, having gained my own copyright on this variant of your file, I will use part of it that I have not written on it's own, thus evading copyright!

You lose, good sir, and I win. May you enjoy your life as a member of the meddling middle management, while I live on as the prettiest pirate in all of penzance!

Now, I wånt to see a dot outside of the bøttom left cornér, so I'µ adding a çouple unicode cha®acters.
