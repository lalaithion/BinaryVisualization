this is an ascii file

It only has ascii characters.

On unix systems, that means it's pretty dense, information wise. However, Java and Windows, among other systems, actually use UTF-16 as their base encoding, not UTF-8. This means, surprisingly, that english (asii) is not more compact than, for instance, greek or arabic or hebrew.

Anyway, this nly has to exist for dumb reasons, and not for, you know, actualy giving any informatuon.

Llama

dalai lama

sick Llama bro,

Llama looks weirder at the beginning of the word because of the one capiuta el and the one lowecase el. Does it look better like LLama? Actually, kinda, but the best is still llama.
